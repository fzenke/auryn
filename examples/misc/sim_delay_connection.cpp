 * \brief Example simulation illustrating the effect of delay connection.
 *
 * The simulation sets up a single input neuron and connects it to a single output neuron via a SparseConnection
 * (which only has the axonal delay from IFGroup) and via a DelayConnection which has both the axonal delay plus
 * an added 10ms dendritic delay. The latter connection is GABAergic to make it easily differntiable in the 
 * membrane trace.
