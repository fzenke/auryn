Auryn 
=====

Auryn is Simulator for recurrent spiking neural networks with synaptic
plasticity. It comes with the GPLv3 (please see COPYING).

* For examples and documentation visit https://www.fzenke.net/auryn/
* Please reporte issues here https://github.com/fzenke/auryn/issues

Quick start
-----------

Note, Auryn needs a C++ compiler, the boost libraries (www.boost.org) with MPI
support installed. To download and compile the examples under Linux try:

```
sudo apt-get install cmake git build-essential libboost-all-dev
git clone https://github.com/fzenke/auryn.git && cd auryn/build/release
./bootstrap.sh && make
```

Run a first network simulation
------------------------------

```
cd examples
./sim_coba_benchmark --dir .
```
will run the Vogels Abbott benchmark, a balanced network model with conductance based synapses.
Spiking activity is written to files with the extension 'ras'. 

If you have gnuplot installed, you can visualize the output of the simulation follows:
```
echo "set xlabel 'Time [s]'; plot [1:2] 'coba.0.e.ras' with dots lc rgb 'black'" | gnuplot -p
```

![Spike raster plot](http://www.fzenke.net/auryn/lib/exe/fetch.php?cache=&media=coba_ras.png "coba ras")

Here time in seconds is plotted on the x-asis and neuron id on the y-axis.



Install as a library
--------------------

To install Auryn as a library run:
```
sudo make install
```
which will put it under `/usr/local/` or for a local install
```
make DESTDIR=./your/dir/ install
```
