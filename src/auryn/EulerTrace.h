 * This solver simultaneoulsy computes linear traces (mostly to implement
 * synapses) using Euler's method. Another solver is readily available within
 * the Auryn framework. The LinearTrace objects solves the same problem but
 * using the analytic solution. This results in less updates. However - so far
