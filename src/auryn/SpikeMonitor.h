/*! \brief The standard Monitor object to record spikes from a 
 * SpikingGroup and write them to a text file
 *
 * SpikeMonitor is specified with a source group of type SpikingGroup
 * and writes all or a specified range of the neurons spikes to a
 * text (ras) file that has to be given at construction time.
 *
 * SpikeMonitor writes spikes into rank specific files and timestamps 
 * them before the axonal delay (this is generally what you want). 
 * DelaySpikeMonitor in contrast writes spikes after the axonal delay 
 * and records all spikes from all ranks and all all ranks (this is 
 * maninly for debugging).
