/*! \brief A Checker class that tracks population firing rate as a moving
 * average and breaks a run if it goes out of bound.
 *
 * This class should be specified at least once with all plastic runs to ensure
 * that expoding firing rates or a silent network does not get simulated
 * needlessly for hours.
 *
 * The different constructors allow to specify different min and max firing
 * rates to guard against too active or quiet networks.  Also the timeconstant
 * (tau) over which the moving rate average is computed online can be specified.
 * Allow for 3-5 x tau for the estimate to settle to its steady state value.  To
 * avoid accidental breaking of a run due to this effect, at initialization the
 * rate estimate is assumed to  be the mean of the min and max. Note further
 * that this checker computes population averages over the fraction of a neuron
 * group which is simulated on a particular rank.  In highly parallel
 * simulations when the number of neurons per rank is very the rate estimate
 * might have a high variance accross ranks.  If highly parallel simulation is
 * anticipated tau should be chosen longer to avoid spurious breaks caused by a
 * noisy rate estimate or a different checker which computes the rate of entire
 * population (after a MINDELAY s minimal delay) should be used.
