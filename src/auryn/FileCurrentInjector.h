/*! \brief Stimulator class which reads "currents" from a file and applies them to arbitrary neuronal states.
 *
 * Most commonly used to inject "currents" to arbitraty neuronal states. Maintains an internal vector with
 * numbers which are added (times auryn_timestep) in each timestep to the neuronal target vector 
 * (per default that is the membrane voltage and hence the operation corresponds to injecting a current).
 * Note that because of this current units of FileCurrentInjector are in a sense arbitrary because they depend 
 * on the neuron model. The scale of inputs can be with the set_scale runction.
 *
 * Upon construction the FileCurrentInjector accepts a human readable file in
 * two-column format which stores the current time series.  The first column
 * should contain the time in s and the second column the corresponding current
 * values. Missing current values are interpolated linearly.
 * Here is an example for a valid time series file:
 *
 *     0.000000 0.000000
 *     0.050000 0.125333
 *     0.100000 0.248690
 *     0.150000 0.368125
 *     0.200000 0.481754
 *     0.250000 0.587785
 *     0.300000 0.684547
