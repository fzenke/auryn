/*! \brief This NeuronGroup implements the Izhikevich neuron model with conductance based AMPA and GABA synapses
 *
 * This NeuronGroup implements the nonlinear integrate and fire neuron model by Eugene M. Izhikevich as described in 
 * Izhikevich, E.M. (2003). Simple model of spiking neurons. IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks 14, 1569â€“1572.
 *
 * In this implementation the state variables have been rescaled to V and seconds for consistency. The model is controlled 
 * via the public members: avar, bvar, cvar, dvar which correspond to the a,b,c and d parameters in the paper.
 *
 * Note that since this model has been rescaled to volts and seconds the reset and jump size parameters (cvar and dvar)
 * also need to be given in volts (i.e. scaled by 1e-3).
 *
 * Also keep in mind that the default interpretation of synaptic synaptic strength given in multiples of the leak
 * conductance is not longer true for this group and you will need to "gauge" synaptic strength according to the size of 
 * membrane potential deflection it causes.
