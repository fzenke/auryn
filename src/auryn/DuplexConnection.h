/*! \brief Duplex connection is the base class of most plastic connections.
 * 
 * DuplexConnection serves as base class for plastic connections that want to implement
 * synaptic weight change in response to a postsynaptic spike. This requires the post
 * spike to be signalled back to the presynaptic cell (rather the connecting synapse).
 * To do this efficiently, the weight matrix (ForwardMatrix) which allows for efficient 
 * forward propagation of spikes is mirrored as its transposed (BackwardMatrix). 
 * To keep the two matrices in sync the BackwardMatrix does not contain the actual weight
 * value to the forward weight, but a pointer reference to that value.
