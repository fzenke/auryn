/*! \brief A special Poisson generator that mimicks thalamo-cortical input to

 *
 * The object simulates a single pure tone stimulus at the beginning of every
 * stimulation_period during stimulus_duration. At the beginning of each
 * stimulus spikes occurr timelocked (every cell in the group spikes in exactly
 * the same time bin). Followed by a poisson firing with rate_on during the
 * stimulus_duration. Afterwards the group defaults back to normal poisson
 * firing with rate_off.
