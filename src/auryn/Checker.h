/*! \brief The abstract base class for all checkers
 *
 * Checkers are online monitors that can be used to break a run.
 * In many simulations involving plasticity it is for instance 
 * useful to monitor the average firing rate of the network. If 
 * it drops to zero or explodes this can trigger the abortion of
 * the run to avoid hammering of the fileserver or other loss
 * of resources. The most dominant checker for this purpose is
 * RateChecker that should be included in every simulation.
