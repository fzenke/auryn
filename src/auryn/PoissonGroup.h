/*! \brief A SpikingGroup that creates poissonian spikes with a given rate.
 *
 * This is the standard Poisson spike generator of Auryn. It implements a 
 * group of given size of Poisson neurons all firing at the same rate. 
 * The implementation is very efficient if the rate is constant throughout.
 *
 * The random number generator will be seeded identically every time. Use 
 * the seed function to seed it randomly if needed. Note that all PoissonGroups
 * in a simulation share the same random number generator. Therefore it 
 * sufficed to seed one of them.
